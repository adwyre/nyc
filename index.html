          <span>New York, often called New York City or simply NYC</span>
          is the most populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. 
          The city comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county. It is a global city and a cultural, financial, 
          high-tech, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care, scientific output, life sciences, research, 
          technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an 
          important center for international diplomacy, and it is sometimes described as the world's most important city and the capital of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
          New York City is frequently the setting for novels, movies, and television programs and has been described as the cultural capital of the 
          world. In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, "Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather."
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
          The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract 
          expressionism (known as the New York School) in painting; and hip-hop, punk, hardcore, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, 
          certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world.

          The central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway. 
          Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
          Broadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that 
          crosses Times Square, sometimes referred to as "The Great White Way".
